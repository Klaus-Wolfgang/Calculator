# Calculator
Calculator app which can be converted to .exe and used locally

To convert the .py to .exe, both pyinstaller and auto-py-to-exe are installed and added to the system variablee PATHs
since the cmd was broken I had to manually locate and run the autopytoexe and convert the py to exe.

Major drawback of this app is its python(High level language) so... very very slow to load.
